<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Elijah Carvalho, I'm currently 26 years old and I'm new to coding! I've also dabbled in 3D modelling in software like Blender and have a 
  dedent understanding of how to do UX Design, although I've never done either of them in a job. In the next few years I plan to master coding
  and use it together with UX Design so that I have multiple marketable skills!
</p>

<p>I've lived in four states! I was born and raised in Southern Alabama. After graduating High School I moved to Houston Texas
  and worked a construction job. Then I moved to Southern California for two years. Afterward I moved to Denver Colorado for a year. 
  Now I'm back in California, athough I plan to move back to my home state soon! 
</p>

<p>I work well in teams, I love using team work to solve problems, which in coding, there are many to run into!
  I have patience too, so I'll be calm whenever I run into a problem when coding. I plan to pair this skill with my
  3D modelling skills and hopefully help create a video game one day!
